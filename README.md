## Planned Features

* Support for project files that manage one or multiple code snippets
  (and potentially also external or embedded binary files)
* Display a list of nodes in the scene and their parameters
* The default code editor should become a node where you can enter code
  or load a Python source file via its parameters
* Object-oriented and resource-safe OGL abstraction
  * \+ 2D and 3D viewport API
  * \+ Simple to use off-screen rendering API (incl. capability of processing
    in a separate thread and displaying results/progress from the main thread)
* Ability to save sequence of images rendered with OpenGL (eg. as PNG,
  MP4 or GIF)
* Better code editor! Or at least automatic reloading when referencing a file
